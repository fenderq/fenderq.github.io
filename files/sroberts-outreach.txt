Skills & Strengths

Emotional Intelligence - Looking after my Mother who had terminal illness I became self aware of my own burnout and learned how to manage it in a healthy way. Letting go instead of trying to control. Asking for help. Sometimes it is simply taking a pause asking, what am I feeling and why, having patience with myself and others.
Facilitation - Being calm and non-reactive during tense times, grounding others. Maintaining flow and balance in a group. Timing and language choices based on the learned values from others.
Psychosocial Rehabilitation - Being an empathic listener, and a witness to what someone needs to share, creating a reflection, with myself aside. Being present so a person does not have to discover their own path alone.
Self Care - Eating healthy. Low blood pressure. Green tea. Listening to music to embrace the rainbow of emotions. Staying connected with people in the community. Knowing when to rest and take time for myself. Being able to make happy little clouds, and grow like a tree with strong roots.
Spirituality - I can simply exist for everything to be how it should.

------------------------------

My range of experiences is a unique combination that I can contribute to your team.

Music has always been a very healthy part of my life. It has been useful as a game developer producing soundtracks using electronics, guitar teacher and performer in bands live on stage. 

Video game development taught me how to produce a product, and finish something complex. The experience enabled me to learn how to work well with creative minds, and learn from mistakes as an entrepreneur.

Hairschool was a humbling experience having recently come from an executive position with a financial tech company. I re-learned how to learn from nothing, with no previous knowledge or experience. It was all about people, yet I could still find geometry and chaos theory mathematics in the artform.

Cryptography is trust and safety in numbers. Seeing a young adult grasp Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange during an art program is seeing a person solve a puzzle in their mind.
